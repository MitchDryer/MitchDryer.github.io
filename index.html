sheep are like a stroke of luck<br>
on an ordinary day<br>
<br>
sheep are like a nice dream forgotten<br>
but the feeling still remains<br>
<br>
sheep are like a cloud<br>
a cloud is like a sheep<br>
<br>
sheep are really gentle<br>
and don't get very angry<br>
<br>
sheep are probably warm<br>
because of woollen socks<br>
<br>
sheep don't seem very smart<br>
and i'm sure that they are not<br>
<br>
i have never seen a sleeping sheep<br>
maybe they sleep while they're awake<br>
